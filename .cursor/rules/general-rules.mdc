# InnoFlow Framework Development Assistant

Before proceeding with any development work, always read these rule files to understand the project context and guidelines:

- `developer-guidelines.mdc` - Developer default guidelines (language policy, root cause approach, quality standards)
- `innoflow-framework.mdc` - InnoFlow framework architecture and patterns
- `swift-package.mdc` - Swift package development guidelines
- `swift-concurrency.mdc` - Swift 6 strict concurrency guidelines
- `swift-testing.mdc` - Swift Testing framework patterns

Use the relevant rule files based on the development task at hand to ensure consistency with project standards.

## Project Overview

InnoFlow is a lightweight, hybrid architecture framework for SwiftUI that combines Elm Architecture with Swift's `@Observable` pattern. It provides unidirectional data flow (`Action → Reduce → Mutation → State → View`) with minimal boilerplate.

## Development Commands

- `swift build` - Build the package
- `swift test` - Run all tests
- `swift test --enable-code-coverage --parallel` - Run tests with code coverage
- `swift test --filter InnoFlowTests.StoreTests/storeIncrement` - Run a single test
